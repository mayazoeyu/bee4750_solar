    "> The following model will conduct a feasibility study of solar energy production on Cornell's Engineering Quadrangle. As Cornell’s Climate Action Plan seeks to have Cornell’s Ithaca campus carbon neutral by 2035 through utilizing 100% renewable energy, the proposed research will analyze if solar energy would help to achieve these goals. As such, the study will analyze how Cornell can invest in solar photovoltaics (PV) to increase this percentage – focusing mainly on the Engineering Quadrangle. In addition, the model will analyze the theoretical production of solar rooftop PV systems while optimzing cost. \n"
